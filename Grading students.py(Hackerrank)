HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

Every student receives a grade  in the inclusive range from 0 to 100.
Any grade less than 40  is a failing grade.
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:

If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3, round grade up to the next multiple of 5 .
If the value of grade  is less than 38, no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
For example, grade = 84  will be rounded to 85  but grade = 29  will not be rounded because the rounding would result in a number that is less than 40.

Given the initial value of grade for each of Sam's n students, write code to automate the rounding process.
